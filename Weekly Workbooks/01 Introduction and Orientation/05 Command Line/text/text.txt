During this workbook, we have spent the majority of the time exploring the use of IntelliJ.
At this stage however, it is worth spending a little bit of time taking a look at how we can build and run
Java projects from the command line. This is important because the exercises later on in the
unit (and especially the final assignment) will be tested on the command line.
For this reason, you will need to make sure that you are able to build and run code on the command line yourself.

You may have used *GNU Make* previously - this software saves you from having
to manually type out all the compile and linking commands every time you want to build your software.
`make` takes care of running all the required build commands (as specified in the `Makefile`)
and intelligently works out what needs to be done.
`make` however isn't commonly used for Java development since building Java projects
usually involves much more complicated activities than just running a set of commands.
This is where the **Maven** build system comes in - it provides various tools for building and running complex Java projects.

On your command line, change into the project root folder (the directory where the `pom.xml` file resides) and type one of the following commands (depending on your platform). Note that on some Linux systems, you _might_ need to make `mvnw` executable first (i.e. by running `chmod`):

    Linux/OSX:   ./mvnw clean compile
    Windows:     mvnw clean compile

The command above is doing 2 separate things in sequential order:

1. `clean` ensures that everything will be freshly built by cleaning out (deleting) previously generated files
2. `compile` compiles and builds all files and resources (stopping if any build errors are encountered)

Note that you can learn more about these and other build commands in the official <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html" target="_blank">Maven documentation</a>.

The first time you run the compile command, it might take a while to complete so be patient. This is because Maven may need to download various project dependencies before it can even try to compile your code. If successful, the output in the terminal window should looks something like this:

    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] Total time: 42 s
    [INFO] Finished at: 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you get a `BUILD FAILURE`, it means that Maven has failed to complete some of the specified tasks.
If this is the case, it would be wise to go back into IntelliJ and make sure no code issues are detected there
(i.e. no code is highlighted in red and the project can still be built and run inside IntelliJ).
Fix any problems in IntelliJ first and then return to the command line.
If you still can't get your code to compile on the command line, get some help in the practical session
(It is important you are able to complete this task before moving on to future workbooks).

Once you have successfully built your code on the command line, you can run your program using one of the following:

    Linux/OSX:   ./mvnw exec:java
    Windows:     mvnw exec:java

For a given project, there may be many different things that can be executed - the above command runs the `main` method of the Java part of the project (currently the only thing we have written).
