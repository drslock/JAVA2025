Previously on this programme, the emphasis was on learning to program.
In this current teaching block, we will be focusing on the skills required to turn you into a _developer_.
Part of this skillset is the ability to effectively use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
In this unit, we will therefore be using the IntelliJ IDE in order to support development.
This is already installed on the lab machines and can be found either via the application menus or on the command line at 
`/opt/idea/2025/bin/idea.sh`. This installation _should_ already have the UoB license enabled, 
if however it asks you to provide license details when you first run it, enter the following as the on-site license server:
`http://ls-jetbrains.bris.ac.uk:8080`

You do not HAVE to install IntelliJ on your own laptop, however many people choose to do so (in order to work from home).
If you plan to use your own computer for writing code, now is a good time to get IntelliJ installed.
Follow the step-by-step installation instructions that can be found in the "Weekly Briefings" folder on GitHub.
For a more detailed walk-through, see the following platform-specific videos for getting started with IntelliJ on
