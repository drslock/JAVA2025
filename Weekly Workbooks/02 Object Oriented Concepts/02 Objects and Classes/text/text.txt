**Objects** and **Classes** are fundamental building blocks of Object Oriented code that were introduced in the lecture session.
The slides and videos linked to above provide a recap of these concepts - what them again now if you need to refresh your memory.
Once you are happy with the concepts presented in the lecture materials, attempt the following practical activity in order to apply your knowledge:
- Open up the `Shapes` project that we gave you last week and find the `Triangle` class file (it should be somewhere in the `src/main/java` folder !)
- Add a constructor method to the `Triangle` class that takes three `int` parameters (which will be the lengths of each side of the triangle)
- Add some `int` attributes to the top of the `Triangle` class and use these to store the lengths of the three sides passed into the constructor
- Write a method called `getLongestSide` that returns the length of the longest side of the triangle (i.e. the largest of the three ints)

Inside the project's `main` method (which is contained in the `Shapes` file), add the following code to create a new instance of
the `Triangle` class and print out its longest side:

``` java
Triangle testTriangle = new Triangle(5, 7, 9);
int longestSide = testTriangle.getLongestSide();
System.out.println("The longest side of the triangle is " + longestSide);
```

Create a number of different instances of `Triangle`, each with different length sides
and check that your `getLongestSide` method operates as expected for each instance.

Notice how in the above code you can "glue" separate Strings together in Java by using the `+` concatenation operator.
Java will even let you concatenate _different_ types together (in the above example, a `String` and an `int`).

Now use this knowledge to add a `toString` method to your Triangle class that returns a suitable `String` that describing the Triangle
(For example, `toString` should return `This is a Triangle with sides of length 4, 5, 7`)
